VideoRatioProblemPerDevice
==========================

~~Issue with the Samsung Galaxy S3 not playing videos at the correct ratio~~

Issue with the MediaPlayer not retrieving the correct video width x height.

**I have now updated this repo with a fix for this issue by hard coding the WxH.**
Obviously not the best fix because I still haven't worked out why it is not returning this WxH from the MediaPlayer.

Here is the video information, as you can see the WxH is 640x480 but the recommended size is 853x480
(I would say the recommended size is the correct size).

I now think all the screenshots below had an incorrect ratio, 
just by coincidence the Galaxy Nexus was pretty close to correct! but not quite.

~~Galaxy Nexus Full Screen correct ratio:~~
